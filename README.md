# Coursera's Course of Machine Learning by Andrew Ng
This repository contains all the programming assignments completed while learning the course. Below is a brief description of assignments done in each week of the course.

## Week 1
Week 1 of the course had no practical assignments as it was an introduction to basic concepts and terminologies related to the Introduction To Machine Learning.

## Week 2
In Week 2 of the course, the practical assignment's aim was to learn Linear Regression (UniVariate and MultiVariate) using Gradient Descent and even Normal Equations.
The assignments include Visualising the data, performing Feature Normalization on the data, Computing Cost Functions and respective Gradients, using Gradient Descent Alogrithm and
Normal Equation Algorithm. 

We implemented Linear Regression to predict proﬁts for a food truck. Supposing we were the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet.
The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for proﬁts and populations from the cities.
You would like to use this data to help you select which city to expand to next. 

## Week 3
In Week 3 of the course, the practical assignment's aim was to learn Logistic Regression.
The assignments include Visualising the data, performing Feature Normalization on the data, Computing Cost Functions, respective Gradients and adding Regularization Terms

In the first half of the assigment we implemented Logistic Regression to predict whether a student, given his exam scores, gets admitted to a Univeristy or not. The second half
of the assignment, we tried to predict if a microchip from a fabrication plant would pass a Quality Assurance test or not.

## Week 4
In Week 4 of the course, the practical assignment's aim was to learn Multi-class Classification using One-vs-All method and learn Basics of Neural Network
The assignments include Visualising the data, Computing Cost Functions, respective Gradients and adding Regularization Terms

In the first half of the assigment we recognize handwritten digits using One-vs-All Classification. The second half
of the assignment, Given the accuracte weights we applied feed forward algorithm on a Neural Network to recognize handwritten digits.

## Week 5
In Week 5 of the course, the practical assignment's aim was to learn Backpropagation on Neural Network to recognize handwritten digits
The assignments include Visualising the data and hidden layers, Computing Cost Functions, respective Gradients, applying backpropagation algorithm and adding regularization terms on the Network

In the previous assignment, we just did feedforward to a network given the perfect weights. In this week's assignment, we applied backpropagation algorithm to learn those weights from scratch.

## Week 6
In Week 6 of the course, the practical assignment's aim was to learn the concept of Bias and Variance using a Linear Regression based application.
The assignments include Computing Cost Functions, respective Gradients, adding Regularization Terms and Visualising the data to analyse the problems related to Bias and Variance.

In the first half of the assigment we implement regularized Linear Regression to predict the amount of water flowing out of a dam using a change of water level in a reservoir.
The second half of the assignment, first we changed our simple Linear Regression into Polynomial Linear Regression and then went through diagnosing problems related to
Bias and Variance by visualising the learning process and debug the algorithm we built in the first half.

## Week 7
In Week 7 of the course, the practical assignment's aim was to learn the implementation of Support Vector Machine (SVM), how to use Gaussian Kernels and its importance.
The assignments include Computing Cost Functions, respective Gradients, adding Regularization Terms and Visualising the data to analyse changes in SVM.

In the first half of the assigment we implement SVMs to gain intuition on the concept, learn why its important and concepts of Kernels. In the second half of the assignment,
we implement a Support Vector Machine to build a Email Spam Classifier. Other tasks in building a Spam Classifier also included processing the emails so that we could pass it as an input in SVM.

## Week 8
In Week 8 of the course, the practical assignment's aim was to learn Unsupervised Learning using K-means Clustering algorithm and PCA (Principle Component Analysis).
The assignments include finding the closest Centroids and computing Centroid positions for the K-means Clustering Algorithm.

In the first half of the assigment we implement K-Means Clustering algorithm on pixels for Image Compression. We use an image of the bird for the algorithm. After learning K-Means
Algorithm, We move forward to the concept of Dimensionality Reduction using PCA (Principle Component Analysis). The second part of the assignment includes building a PCA and try it on
lower dimensional data and then to use the same PCA algorithm on a larger datasets of 5000 face image dataset with high dimensions. In addition to the image compression we did using K-means,
we also plot a 3D visualization of color clusters for the image. Then we use PCA on those clusters to plot on a 2D surface as it easier to visualize.

## Week 9
In Week 9 of the course, the practical assignment's aim was to learn the Anomaly Detection Algorithm and Build a recommendation system.
The assignments include computing parameters for multivariate Gaussian, Visualising the data to analyse the process if Anomaly Detection.

In the first half of the assigment, we build an anomaly detection model to detect anamalous behaviors in server computers, selecting a proper threshold for the algorithm on the basis of F1 score.
In the second half of the assignment, implement a Recommender Syster to recommend movies based on Ratings using Collaborative Filtering among multiple users. In this half, we can also rate movies according
to our taste and then get our own movie recommendations.

## Week 10 and Week 11
In week 10 and 11 of the course, we do not have any practical assignments because we then focus on the problems faced in the real world and how to tackle them using certain methods.
